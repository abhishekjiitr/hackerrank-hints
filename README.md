# Hackerrank Hints

Useful resources and practice problems for the Hackerrank challenges.

### Purpose

Hackerrank contains a set of interesting questions, but does not provide additional material as in how to learn about the various algorithms and techniques. The first track of "Algorithmic Challenges" is a set of excellent tutorials, but after that, only the problem is given.

Here I try to put some useful materials (at least useful to me) together to help fellow challenge solvers.
